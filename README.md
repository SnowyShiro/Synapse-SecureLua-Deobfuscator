Synapse securelua was deobfuscated in October 2022 and this is the source code of that deobfuscator! Quite messy, I know, but Inori needed to get what he deserves for taking Lindsey!

You need lua 5.3 set up on visual studio.

No support will be given. This is just meant to be looked at to see how funny the deobfuscation was!
Only supports the securelua Alpha VM with no constant encryption macros. Would have had support for Beta and Charlie VMs, and wanted to destroy fiusen hub and superouro hub too but nintendo boi found out before I got the chance! Also didn't have time to finish constant decryption!

Example securelua bytecode is in `newestlin.txt`, and example deobfuscated lua 5.1 bytecode output is `newestlin.txt_unsec`, and unluac output of linoria is in `unluac_output.txt`

This is the end of an era!
